# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy

**A Business-Driven Analytics Case Study**

## 📌 Case Study Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses, directly impacting recurring revenue, customer lifetime value (CLV), and growth efficiency.

This case study presents an end-to-end churn analytics solution built for a B2C subscription business experiencing early-stage customer attrition.
Rather than treating churn as a historical metric, this project reframes it as a forward-looking business risk that can be predicted, measured, and mitigated.

The primary outcome of this project is an interactive Power BI dashboard that converts churn predictions into actionable, revenue-focused insights for business teams.

## 🎯 Business Problem

The business observed a steady increase in churn occurring within the first 30 days of subscription, leading to:

* Loss of Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
* Reduced Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
* Inefficient Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC recovery
* Limited visibility into churn risk and revenue exposure

Existing churn reports were reactive, focusing on past churn events without enabling proactive intervention.

## 🧠 Case Study Objectives

The objectives of this case study are to:

* Identify customers at risk of churn before churn occurs
* Segment customers into Low, Medium, and High churn risk
* Quantify monthly revenue at risk
* Identify behavioral and plan-related churn drivers
* Enable data-driven, targeted retention strategies


## 📊 Solution Overview

The solution is delivered through three interconnected Power BI dashboards, each serving a distinct business purpose.

### 1️⃣ Customer Churn Overview (Executive Dashboard)

Provides a high-level snapshot of:

* Overall churn rate
* Average churn probability
* High-risk customer percentage
* Revenue at risk
* Churn probability distribution

**Audience:** Leadership and strategy teams

**Purpose:** Rapid assessment of churn severity and revenue exposure

### 2️⃣ Churn Drivers & Customer Segmentation

Focuses on diagnosing why churn occurs, highlighting:

* Key behavioral churn drivers (inactivity, complaints, support pain)
* Revenue at risk by subscription plan
* Regional and plan-based churn patterns
* Engagement decline vs churn risk

**Audience:** Product, marketing, and analytics teams

**Purpose:** Root-cause analysis and churn driver identification

### 3️⃣ Churn Risk Action Plan & Retention Strategy

Transforms insights into action by showing:

* High-risk customers requiring immediate intervention
* Revenue exposure by churn risk level
* High-value vs high-risk customer segmentation
* Customer distribution across churn risk tiers

**Audience:** Customer success and retention teams

**Purpose:** Prioritize actions and maximize retention ROI


## 🧩 Data Overview

The dataset represents a B2C subscription business and includes:

* Customer demographics and regions
* Subscription plans and monthly revenue
* Engagement and inactivity metrics
* Support interactions and complaint counts
* Churn labels and churn probability scores

> Note: Data has been anonymized and structured for analytical demonstration purposes.

## ⚙️ Data Preparation & Modeling Logic

* Data quality checks and feature validation were performed
* Churn probability scores were generated using a pre-built predictive model
* Customers were segmented into churn risk tiers using probability thresholds
* Revenue at Risk was calculated by aggregating monthly revenue for high-risk customers
* Business-friendly KPIs were created using Power BI and DAX

## 💡 Key Business Recommendations

* Prioritize high-risk, high-revenue customers for immediate retention
* Trigger early interventions based on inactivity and complaint signals
* Redesign or modernize high-risk subscription plans
* Implement tiered retention strategies by churn risk level
* Track churn probability as a forward-looking customer health metric

## 📈 Business Impact

* Identified ~₹30K in monthly revenue at immediate churn risk
* Enabled proactive churn prevention instead of reactive reporting
* Improved retention prioritization and resource allocation
* Increased ROI on retention and marketing efforts
* Established a scalable churn prevention framework

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX, dashboard design
  
* **Excel / CSV** – Data preparation
  
* **GitHub** – Version control and documentation

## 🚀 Why This Case Study Matters

This case study demonstrates the ability to:

* Frame analytics around real business problems
* Translate predictive outputs into actionable decisions
* Communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders
* Deliver analytics solutions with measurable business value
